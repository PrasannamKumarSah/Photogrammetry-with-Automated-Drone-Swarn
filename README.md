# Photogrammetry-with-Automated-Drone-Swarn
The idea behind this project is to create 3D model with aerial images that were captured by automated drone swarm.

# Project outline
In this Project we created a 3D model of a residential house using the technique of Photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is the technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment by the use of photographs. So, to make a 3D model and practice photogrammetry we need a object whose model we will make and drones that will capture multiple images from many different angles for us. For photogrammetry we should always keep in mind that the images the we are capturing should have a minimum overlap of about (60 to 70)% for accurate data and model. Instead of practicing it on real we choose to simulate it. So we choose AirSim as Simulator and its Python API to automate all swarm drones. Now after drone automation and its simulation in AirSim we have our required images captured by Drone. Now to Process all these images and to create a accurate 3D Model we choose Agisoft Metashape Professional. Using Agisoft Metashape we process the all captured images of site and created a very good 3D model of our chosen object. To know more see this video. Each and every step is elaborated in this video.
